Well you only need the light when it’s burning low
Only miss the sun when start to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you’ve been high when you are feeling low
Only hate the road when you’re missing’ home
Only know you love her when you let her go

and you let her go..

Staring at the bottom of the glass
Hoping one day you’ll make a dream last
But dream come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
May be one day you will understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Well you only need the light when it’s burning low
Only miss the sun when start to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you’ve been high when you are feeling low
Only hate the road when you’re missing’ home
Only know you love her when you let her go
